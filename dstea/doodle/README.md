Building Docker Doodles
-----------------------

Building can be done with the original `docker build`, or with the new *BuildKit* application.  The new
experimental 'buildx' command, which is in nightly builds as well as in the Docker Engine 19.03 release,
provides a new, albeit familiar front end to BuildKit similar to the original `docker build` command.
BuildKit has some great new added features such as increased performance, and the ability to easily build
cross platform.

To build for your own platform with the original docker build command, use:

`cd <doodle> && docker build -t <username>/doodle:<doodle> ./`

To build cross platform, use the `Dockerfile.cross` file, either with *BuildKit* directly, or with *buildx*.
With buildx, you'll first need to create a cross platform `builder` instance with:

`docker buildx create --use`

You only need to create one builder instance, and should not need to create new ones with subsequent
builds.  To create and push the multi-arch image to Docker Hub, use the command:

`cd <doodle> && docker buildx build -f Dockerfile.cross --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v8,linux/s390x,linux/ppc64le,windows/amd64 -t <usename>/doodle:<doodle> --push .`

This will build the Doodle for these architectures:
* linux/amd64 (64 bit Linux native)
* linux/arm64 (suitable for Amazon EC2 A1 instances)
* linux/arm/v8 (suitable for Raspberry Pi)
* linux/s390x (for mainframe lovers)
* linux/ppc64le (for IBM POWER8 Little Endian)
* windows/amd64 (64 bit Windows native)
